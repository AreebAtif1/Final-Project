My Name is Areeb Atif, I am a 17 year old rising senior from New Jersey. More of my work can be seen on my
Github page (https://github.com/AreebAtif1).

If you need to reach me, my email is areebatif2007@gmail.com

My project is about how BMI and diabetes are correlated and at what level of BMI puts an individual at a great risk of diabetes. Here is the link to my Github Repo (https://github.com/AreebAtif1/Final-Project).

This project was created as a part of Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/.
